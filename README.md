Promotional Website

This website is the promotional website for Neuronexus 2019 Team 14.

## Running on another Computer
If you are interested in making changes to the website, you should follow these steps to get it running on your computer:

1. Install nodejs and npm. You can find out how at https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install
2. Install all requirements using npm. In your terminal, in the root repo folder, type `npm install`
3. Open the website using your favourite live reload server. I like https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
